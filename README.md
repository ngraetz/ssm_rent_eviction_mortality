Code to replicate the results of Graetz, Nick, Carl Gershenson, Sonya R. Porter, Danielle H. Sandler, Emily Lemmerman, Matthew Desmond. (2023). "The impacts of rent burden and eviction on mortality in the United States, 2000–2019."

All our empirical results use confidential microdata from the U.S. Census Bureau. We are not able to make these data directly available. However, we can provide the code and researchers can follow the directions on how to write a proposal to gain access to the data via a Federal Statistical Research Data Center using the Standard Application Process. The code to conduct our analyses is available here: https://github.com/ngraetz/ssm_rent_eviction_mortality. To replicate our data and analyses, researchers would submit a common application through the Standard Application Process portal to apply for access to our confidential linked data from any of the 16 principal federal statistical agencies and units: https://www.census.gov/about/adrm/fsrdc.html.
